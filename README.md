# project3-buildcraft-product-configurator
Product Configurator for Mass Customization Manufacturing  Product configurator that an end customer or user can use to create a customizable modular product with little to no product knowledge. System will utilize existing data files to create a separate entity which can be used to automatically quote out jobs to a distributor, 2nd line customer or EOL (End of the Line) customer. Key features should include both a manual and guided option to assist all levels of product or company familiarity. Dynamic tables should update as options are selected allowing only compatible items to be selected as each level is populated. Some sort of visual aspect should be integrated so the user can get some idea of what they are configuring. Lanes in the program should allow for multiple use case [ie: B2B (Business to Business), B2B2C (B2B to Customer), B2B2B..et.]  **Overall project is a dynamically expanding option set and feature implementation platform which would best be achieved in an agile development format. This will allow for a workable product while new and more in-depth features are researched and created.
